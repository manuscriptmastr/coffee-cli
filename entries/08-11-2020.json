  "flavor": "None of that especially pointed, puckering lemon zing or any 'off' tastes. This is a very rounded cup — as if the water softened — with the taste blooming and changing over time, then cooling into a minty aftertaste without any weird grassy notes.",
  "score": 8,
  "notes": "Used the Comandante C40 for the first time today. Noticed that the grind looked very coarse but unearthly consistent, like it carved out each tiny pebble. Water drained quickly in bloom phase. Sides of filter were significantly cleaner than with Hario Skerton Pro.",
  "actionItem": "Lower grind to 24 to increase sweetness and body."

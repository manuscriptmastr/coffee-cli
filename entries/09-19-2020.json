  "flavor": "First sip was clean, no tang/bitterness, a conservative grape note, and a smooth mouthfeel. Finish disappears but leaves mouth sticky/parched, indicating sourness rather than astringency. Overall, I liked where this was going â€” it was focused and on its way to well-balanced and glowy. No 'off tastes' or juxtaposition of sourness and astringency.",

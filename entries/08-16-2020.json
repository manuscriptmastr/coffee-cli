  "flavor": "The tasting notes are back! It's like the coffee went back to being '3D'. Still loads of body, but now I get the cherry zing. The characteristic herb or grass note is back as well â€” it's what reminds me this is a Papua New Guinea roast, and also the one 'off' taste I don't personally care for.",

  "observations": "Did not clean sides of filter this time. Kept 45 second bloom and generous swirls/taps/the whole shebang. Drained a little slower than 'normal' but was steady throughout. No stalling.",
  "actionItem": "Back off the 24 just to see whether that improves the overall flavor-to-body ratio balance."

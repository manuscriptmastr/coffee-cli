  "flavor": "Overall, still sour but better than the last. Initially hit with a strong, tangy note like a very tart apple or strong citrus. There is a familiar 'cream' note accompanying it when I first take a sip â€” usually when I taste/feel that note, it means I'm getting closer to a more balanced cup.",
  "score": 5,
  "observations": "Bloom swirled with 60g water for 6 seconds ('ONE, TWO... SEVEN!'). 45 seconds felt rather long as the the coffee was drying out a bit. Coffee drawdown was very moderate this time. Moderate swirl and tap.",
  "actionItem": "Looks like swirling an extra 5 seconds added 17 seconds to drawdown. Either swirl bloom a little longer to see if that further impacts time, or change grind to 23 with same technique."

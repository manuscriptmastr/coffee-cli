  "flavor": "First hit with a dark, sharp, and tangy grape note. Persists throughout sip. As I swallow, I 'feel' a tea/herb note, then am left with a tangy, alkaline aftertaste. I think the extraction on this was probably close, and that I just don't like this coffee. It's juicy, but the wrong juice. Kenyans are just as juicy but more sweet, citrus, orange.",

  "notes": "8 second bloom swirl with 60g water. Drawdown was quite fast, not sure what the difference was unless grinding a bit finer produced fewer fines.",

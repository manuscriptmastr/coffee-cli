  "flavor": "Wow. In spite (or because) of the long drawdown, this is easily the most luscious, full-bodied, three-dimensional, balanced cup from these beans. The fruit note is not overwhelming like last time and is well-balanced with sweetness, the finish just 'melts', no astringency. However, the taste decreases as the coffee cools.",

  "notes": "Water was already draining very slowly by the time I filled to the top. I did a generous swirl and tap twice, not sure that was a good idea, but it did finish without stalling.",
  "actionItem": "Try one more time at 24. Research what the diminishing taste on cooldown warrants."

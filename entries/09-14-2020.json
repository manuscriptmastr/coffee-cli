  "notes": "Accidentally did 78g of water. Poured as fast as possible, finished 200g by 1:55, finished pour by 1:17. Lots of boulders at edge due to agitation. Drawdown was much faster — I had to do the Rao spin as soon as I rinsed off my spoon.",
  "actionItem": "This was a success — we attempted to change brew time with flow rate only, and ended up shaving 20 seconds rather than 10. Reduce flow rate a bit to get back to the 3:00–3:05 sweet spot."

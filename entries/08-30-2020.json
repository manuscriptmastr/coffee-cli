  "flavor": "Empty, hollow, dilute, yet syrupy — strangely all the notes have disappeared. The presence of body and sweetness, coupled with the hollow, empty flavor suggests over extraction. From previous cups, it looks like this coffee reaches optimum extraction around 2:30. 2:15 results in a slightly sour, tangy taste; 2:45 results in a '2D' cup.",

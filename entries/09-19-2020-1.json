  "flavor": "Very different. Surprisingly weak. Fruit note is more of a cold, chilly kind. This would encourage me to grind finer.",

  "notes": "8 second bloom with 70g water, high initial pour, 200g by 1:00, finish at 1:25 (low but fast), S+T around 1:45. For bloom pour, I kept water in the well and it did not drain out nearly as fast (definitely preferred this). Drawdown did not slow down a drip like last time.",

    "notes": "Very, very chilly, dark, focused, midnight blue citrus note. Agitation really pushes acidity forward while suppressing sweetness and finish. Fruit note cools into an intense lime."

    "quantity": 2,
    "quality": 3,
    "notes": "Not very sweet or complex like that rich, creamy, aromatic bourbon base this coffee has produced."

    "quantity": 2,
    "quality": 1,
    "notes": "Just a slight tea finish. Jaw is tense and tongue and teeth feel scratchy and sandpapery."
  },
  "flavor": "Highly concentrated and pungent acidity but flat and watery. Overall concentration is better than last.",
  "score": 6,
  "observations": "Poured into well. Had to assist for drawdown.",
  "actionItem": "Very interesting experiment with high/fast pours. The combination of astringency and weakness is likely due to the initial pour bypassing grounds too quickly. Stick to the bloom swirl and spin for agitation and lower kettle to normal. Keep the speed up."

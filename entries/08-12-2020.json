  "flavor": "Still a clean cup if it was overextracted. The lemon note is rather 'puckery' while the cup itself seems a little flat like I killed the more interesting parts of the coffee. Mouth is left feeling very dry.",

  "notes": "Used 60 grams of water to bloom, swirled generously, followed the bloom. Drawdown was very slow but never stalled. No mud in the coffee bed.",
  "actionItem": "The drawdown may have been a fluke, but try grind size 23. The dry feeling in mouth is called astringency and is similar to the feeling you get after drinking bitter black tea. Definitely overextracted."

  "flavor": "Like other cups around 3 minutes, an otherwise mellow cup gets dominated by that sharp, citrusy tang. I think it's safe to say I'm tasting bitterness â€” it's that overpowering nuance that screams over the better parts of the cup.",

  "notes": "Made a big well in dry coffee bed, swirled vigorously until saturated (8 seconds), poured 200g by 1:05 (not fast at all), finished by 1:35, swirl and tap around 1:45 or 1:50.",
  "actionItem": "Change grind to 24 for Congo only. The good news is that as long as we thoroughly swirl bloom, we're getting a consistent time (3 minutes) and consistent bitterness."
